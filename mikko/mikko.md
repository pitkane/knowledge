- Secret to life is to get

Doing something beoynd
Learn, grow and add value.

“It is easy to blame your lot in life on some outside force, to stop trying because you believe fate is against you. It is easy to think that where you were raised, how your parents treated you, or what school you went to is all that determines your future. Nothing could be further from the truth. The common people and the great men and women are all defined by how they deal with life’s unfairness: Helen Keller, Nelson Mandela, Stephen Hawking, Malala Yousafzai, and—Moki Martin. Sometimes no matter how hard you try, no matter how good you are, you still end up as a sugar cookie. Don’t complain. Don’t blame it on your misfortune. Stand tall, look to the future, and drive on!” ― William H. McRaven

The Samurai Carpenter

You might be like well this guy is little too crazy about his tools here, i'm not crazy about these tools. The reason why i'm so excited, is because this shop is the realisation of the dream that has been ten years in the making. One of the biggest dreams in my life is now a reality. And not only that, this shop has the potential to see countless other dreams be made manifested, right here in this space.
This shop represents freedom, it represents opportunity, it represents everything that our parents and our grandparents lived and died for. You might be thinking oh you are getting little dramatic, but no, that what it is you guys.

This is proof, that when you believe and hold tight in to your dreams, they will be made a reality. So if you have lost hope, if you let your dreams go, let me just tell you: Go and pick them up, and get back to work.

- Life can be much broader once you discover that everything around you that you call life is made up by people that were no smarter than you.
