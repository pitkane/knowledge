### Rob Dial’s Top 10 Book List

1) Think & Grow Rich

In my opinion, this is the best book ever written. It's around 100 years old and every single point in this book still holds true today on how to be successful and take control of your life. It is a true classic and the first book that I recommend you read.

2) The One Thing

I read 40 books last year and this is hands down the best book out of all of them. It is really great for learning how to find your passion and focus on it with all of your effort. The point is to find your “ONE Thing” and put it first.

3) Bold

This book will make you think bigger than you ever have before and expand your mindset on what you think you are truly capable of doing in your life. You will finish this book with more desire to do big things than ever before! The author, Peter, is my new found idle of 2016.

4) Talent is Overrated

I am a big believer that every human can achieve anything that they want with dedication and hard work. This book dives deep into my favorite subject, the 10,000 hour rule, and teaches you why talent can only take someone so far. After a while, hard work must take over for someone to truly be a master at their craft.

5) Mindset: The New Psychology of Success

This book will dive into your mind and break down the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset. Tom Bilyeu, the CEO of Quest Nutrition, said it is the #1 book he recommends to people and it is his favorite book ever.

6) The Five Major Pieces to the Life Puzzle

The author of this book, Jim Rohn, was Tony Robbins first mentor. This was the first book my mentor ever asked me to read at 19 years old and the book that started me on a 10-year journey of personal growth. It is a very short book but is filled with amazing life lessons!

7) Maximum Achievement

You probably won't find this book on most people's top 10 list because it is not well known, but this book is incredible to learn the secrets into conditioning your brain to be successful. It dives deep into your brain and the way it works, so that you can make the necessary steps to being unstoppable.

8) Daring Greatly

This book is a kick in the butt and will make you realize the true power of being vulnerable. Most people believe vulnerability is a sign of weakness, but read this book and I promise you your mind will change!

9) Man's Search for Meaning

This is Tony Robbins' favorite book. It was written by a psychologist who survived living in a Nazi concentration camp. It gives you an idea of how someone in the worst conditions in the world can still find the positives in life. Read this and you will never be able to complain again.

10) Awaken the Giant Within

This book is massive and it covers all areas of your mind and your life. It's a beast to conquer but it is truly an amazing book and absolutely life changing!
